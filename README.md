# openenv-tabular-cleaning-2

`tabular_cleaning_env` is a deterministic OpenEnv environment for a **commerce data readiness suite**.

It simulates a real workflow inside ops, analytics, and ML teams: messy business exports arrive, an agent profiles them, applies structured cleanup actions, gets risky changes reviewed, runs validations, and publishes audited tables that are ready for either downstream operations or model training.

This is a governed data-cleaning workflow built around the standard OpenEnv API.

## What Problem It Solves

Teams routinely receive broken exports from CRMs, storefronts, and scheduling tools:

- columns are renamed or inconsistent
- dates use mixed formats
- labels drift over time
- required fields are missing
- duplicates appear after manual merges or sync bugs

In the real world, this work is often done manually in spreadsheets, with little auditability and a high risk of silently damaging data. This repository packages that workflow as a deterministic environment with transparent scoring.

## Real-World Workflow

The environment models a realistic internal workflow:

1. import a raw operational export
2. profile the table and inspect the change set
3. apply structured cleanup actions
4. approve or reject risky mutations
5. run validation gates
6. export a cleaned artifact bundle
7. publish the final table

That is the core product story: **a human-in-the-loop commerce data readiness workbench**.

## Design Goals

- The task suite models a concrete commerce data-readiness workflow.
- Grading is deterministic and transparent.
- Reward shaping is dense and bounded.
- The action space is structured, typed, and safe.
- The tasks cover realistic source systems without requiring external data or custom training.

## Environment API

The environment follows the standard OpenEnv shape:

- `reset(task_id=...)` returns the initial observation
- `step(action)` returns the next observation with `reward`, `done`, and `metadata`
- `state()` returns the full serializable internal state

Core implementation files:

- [inference.py](inference.py)
- [server/environment.py](server/environment.py)
- [server/app.py](server/app.py)
- [tabular_cleaning_env/models.py](tabular_cleaning_env/models.py)
- [tabular_cleaning_env/tasks.py](tabular_cleaning_env/tasks.py)
- [tabular_cleaning_env/graders.py](tabular_cleaning_env/graders.py)

## Bundled Tasks

The benchmark ships 6 bundled tasks across two coherent tracks.

| Task | Difficulty | Source System | Rows | What the agent must do |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `easy_contacts_cleanup` | Easy | CRM customer contacts export | `18` raw / `18` gold | Fix schema drift, normalize names/emails/customer segments, standardize signup dates, fill missing phones, validate, export, publish |
| `medium_orders_cleanup` | Medium | E-commerce orders export | `20` raw / `16` gold | Normalize statuses and dates, cast amounts, fill missing location fields, remove true duplicates, validate, export, publish |
| `hard_appointments_cleanup` | Hard | Field-service scheduling export | `20` raw / `16` gold | Normalize technician and service-line labels, standardize timestamps, fill missing values, resolve duplicate conflicts deterministically, validate, export, publish |
| `xgb_churn_easy` | Easy | CRM RFM feature export | `10` raw / `10` gold | Normalize segments, standardize purchase dates, fill missing frequency values, cast monetary features, validate, export, publish |
| `lstm_forecast_medium` | Medium | Product sales time-series export | `10` raw / `10` gold | Standardize dates, forward-fill missing quantities, normalize categories, validate, export, publish |
| `lightfm_recs_hard` | Hard | Recommendation interaction export | `10` raw / `10` gold | Normalize user IDs and categories, standardize timestamps, fill missing ratings, cast interaction strengths, validate, export, publish |

Step budgets:

- Easy: `13`
- Medium: `15`
- Hard: `15`

## Sample Data

All bundled task data now uses a task-oriented folder structure under [tasks](tasks).
Each task ships with:

- `raw.csv`
- `ground_truth.csv`
- `metadata.json`

Task folders:

- [easy_contacts_cleanup](tasks/easy_contacts_cleanup)
- [medium_orders_cleanup](tasks/medium_orders_cleanup)
- [hard_appointments_cleanup](tasks/hard_appointments_cleanup)
- [xgb_churn_easy](tasks/xgb_churn_easy)

```

These are curated bundled datasets on purpose: they are large enough to feel like real cleanup work, still deterministic to grade, and still light enough to validate quickly in Docker or on Hugging Face Spaces.

The six tasks stay coherent because they all use the same governed workflow: profile the export, apply typed cleanup actions, review risky changes, validate, export, and publish. The difference is only the downstream destination of the cleaned data.

## Action Space

The action space is typed and intentionally narrow.

Workflow actions:

- `profile_table`
- `view_change_set`
- `run_validations`
- `approve_changes`
- `reject_change`
- `export_cleaned_table`
- `publish_table`

Inspection and cleanup actions:

- `inspect_table`
- `inspect_column`
- `rename_column`
- `strip_whitespace`
- `normalize_case`
- `replace_values`
- `standardize_date`
- `fill_missing`
- `fill_forward`
- `cast_dtype`
- `drop_duplicates`
- `sort_rows`
- `submit`

Supported action fields include:

- `column`
- `new_name`
- `case_mode`
- `replacements`
- `fill_value`
- `dtype`
- `sort_by`
- `ascending`
- `preview_rows`
- `change_id`
- `destination`

## Observation and State

Each observation contains the information an agent needs to act generically:

- task metadata such as `task_id`, `difficulty`, `source_system`, and `task_description`
- table context such as `table_columns`, `table_rows_preview`, `row_count`, and `issues_summary`
- workflow state such as `change_set_summary`, `risky_changes`, `validation_status`, and `export_ready`
- trajectory state such as `last_action`, `last_action_error`, `steps_taken`, and `current_score_estimate`
- `task_rules`, which define the cleaning contract for the current source-system export

The serialized state also tracks:

- current working table
- proposed, approved, and rejected changes
- validation results
- export artifacts
- append-only transformation log

## Rule Packs

Each task exposes a rule pack through `task_rules`, including:

- expected schema
- required columns
- primary key
- date columns
- normalization hints
- fill defaults
- dtype casts
- case normalization targets
- duplicate-resolution rules
- validation checks
- safe vs risky action types
- default export destination

This lets the baseline and any external agent behave generically instead of branching on task name.

## Deterministic Grading

Each task has a bundled reference table and one deterministic scalar grader that emits a task score strictly inside `(0, 1)`.

Grading behavior:

- the official task score comes only from the current cleaned table versus the bundled reference table
- grading aligns the configured output columns, optionally sorts rows by task metadata, and compares cells directly
- numeric grading columns use a small tolerance so formatted numeric outputs can still match exactly intended values
- workflow steps such as validation, export, and publish do not inflate the official task score

## Reward Design

Rewards are shaped but bounded:

- `reward = max(min_visible_reward, current_score - best_score_so_far_before_action)`
- invalid, destructive, or no-op actions emit the minimum visible reward floor instead of `0`
- risky actions may improve score immediately, but they still must be approved before validation/export/publish
- the episode ends when the table is published or when `max_steps` is reached

This produces dense learning signal without unstable negative rewards.

## Baseline Inference

The project includes a root [inference.py](inference.py) that:

- uses the `OpenAI` client for LLM calls
- reads `API_BASE_URL`, `MODEL_NAME`, and `HF_TOKEN`
- requires `HF_TOKEN` with no default
- falls back to a deterministic rule-based planner if the LLM path fails
- emits the exact required parser-safe stdout format

The fallback planner follows the same governed workflow as the environment:

1. `profile_table`
2. apply the next cleanup step
3. `approve_changes` whenever a risky mutation is pending
4. `run_validations`
5. `export_cleaned_table`
6. `publish_table`

Reproducible baseline scores:

- `easy_contacts_cleanup`: `0.999`
- `medium_orders_cleanup`: `0.999`
- `hard_appointments_cleanup`: `0.999`

### Required Inference Log Format

```text
[START] task=<task_name> env=tabular_cleaning_env model=<model_name>
[STEP] step=<n> action=<action_str> reward=<reward_value> done=<true|false> error=<msg|null>
[END] success=<true|false> steps=<n> rewards=<r1,r2,...,rn>
```

## Quick Start

### Local setup

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python3 -m pytest -q
uvicorn server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Run inference

```bash
export API_BASE_URL="https://router.huggingface.co/v1"
export MODEL_NAME="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"
export HF_TOKEN="<your-hf-token>"
python3 inference.py
```

`HF_TOKEN` is required. For local contract checks, a placeholder token is enough because the script falls back to the deterministic planner after transport/auth failures.

### Example client usage

```python
from tabular_cleaning_env.client import TabularCleaningEnv
from tabular_cleaning_env.models import TabularCleaningAction

env = TabularCleaningEnv(base_url="http://localhost:8000")
result = env.reset(task_id="easy_contacts_cleanup")
print(result.observation.task_rules)
result = env.step(TabularCleaningAction(action_type="profile_table"))
print(result.observation.metadata)
env.close()
```

## Validation

Local validation commands:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q
python3 inference.py
docker build -t tabular-cleaning-env .
openenv validate http://localhost:8000
```

If the `openenv` CLI is not available on your machine, validate through the Docker image first. The repository includes `tabular_cleaning_env/openenv_compat.py` for local development fallback, but the submission target is the official OpenEnv runtime installed in the Python 3.11 / Docker environment.

The project includes the core runtime files:

- `openenv.yaml`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `uv.lock`
- root `Dockerfile`
- root `inference.py`
- `server/app.py` with `main()`

## Docker

Build and run locally:

```bash
docker build -t tabular-cleaning-env .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 tabular-cleaning-env
```

Then validate the live container:

```bash
python3 -m uv run --python 3.11 openenv validate http://localhost:8000
```

## Hugging Face Spaces

This project is designed for a containerized Hugging Face Space:

1. create a Docker Space
2. push this repository
3. let the Space build from the root `Dockerfile`
4. add Space settings before first boot:
   - `HF_TOKEN` as a Secret
   - `API_BASE_URL` as a Variable if overriding the default
   - `MODEL_NAME` as a Variable if overriding the default
5. confirm the Space is `Running`
6. validate the public runtime

```bash
python3 -m uv run --python 3.11 openenv validate https://<your-space>.hf.space
```

## Export Artifacts

A successful run produces three downstream-ready artifacts in environment state:

- `cleaned_table`
- `data_quality_report`
- `transformation_audit_log`

That is the real-world value proposition: not just cleaning data, but cleaning it in a way that is reviewable, explainable, and safe to publish.

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

- model validation
- environment reset, step, and state behavior
- deterministic grading
- reward bounds
- workflow approval and publish semantics
- inference log formatting
- README command coverage
